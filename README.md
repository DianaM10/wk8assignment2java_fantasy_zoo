####Usind Java and Android Studio

You have been asked to create a zoo management app so that we can manage our fantasy creatures and other mystical beings. The user must be able to add enclosures, add / remove animals, feed animals and anything else you can dream up!

Additionally:
*  Animals cannot be placed in the same enclosure if they would eat one and other.
*  Animals can be sold.
*  View the total income for the zoo.
*  Animals can randomly go on a rampage and break out of their enclosures
